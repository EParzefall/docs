= ownCloud

An ownCloud storage is a specialized webdav storage, with optimizations
for ownCloud-ownCloud communication. See the webdav documentation to
learn how to configure an ownCloud external storage.

When filling in the *URL* field, use the path to the root of the
ownCloud installation, rather than the path to the WebDAV endpoint. So,
for a server at `\https://example.com/owncloud`, use
`\https://example.com/owncloud` and not
`\https://example.com/owncloud/remote.php/dav`.
