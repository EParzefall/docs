= Manual Installation

In this section, you will find *Installation Guides* you need for installing ownCloud manually.

Please consider the following when deciding which path of installation you are looking at:

The *Detailed Installation Guide* gives more detailed information and describes individual setup
possibilities. It may not fit all audiences as it requires a deeper background knowledge. As a
bonus, it provides ready to use scripts which need some preconfiguration to run successfully.
The scripts are "as it is" and no responsibility is taken.

The *Quick Installation Guides* are _very_ helpful when doing standard setups and all commands
necessary are setup for copy/paste. Using these guides, you are as it says, quickly up and running.
