For how to install the latest stable release of MariaDB, please refer to the
{install-mariadb-latest-url}[MariaDB installation documentation].

[NOTE]
====
If you have an existing installation of MariaDB and upgrade to a higher version, do not forget
to run the following command, to handle the new setup for admin users â€” especially when
upgrading to MariaDB 10.4.3 upwards:

[source,console]
----
sudo mysql_upgrade 
----
====

[NOTE]
====
From MariaDB 10.4.3 onwards, the authentication method has changed to UNIX sockets. 
For details, please refer to: {auth-unix-socket-url}[MariaDB: Authentication Plugin - Unix Socket].
The unix_socket authentication plugin allows the user to use operating system credentials when
connecting to MariaDB via a local UNIX socket. Follow the procedure below to create an admin user
for non-socket login, giving ownCloud access to create it's database respectively for phpMyAdmin. 
_This is not the ownCloud user!_
_Don't forget to change the username and password according to your needs_.

[source,console]
----
sudo mysql
MariaDB [(none)]>
 CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'dbadmin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
 GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'dbadmin'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
 FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
 SHOW GRANTS FOR 'dbadmin'@'localhost';
